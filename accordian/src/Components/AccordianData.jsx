        question: 'Why does Fake Filler always fill random stuff in my forms?',
        answer: "The purpose of Fake Filler is to allow you as a developer or tester to test your forms quickly and easily. The extension will automatically fill in fake data into the forms based on each input field. Using the extension saved you from manually filling out each field, which can become tedious very quickly. Fake Filler never saves any data that is filled in your forms and always generates fake data each time you use it.",
